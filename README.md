What is Gamepass?
-----------------
Gamepass is a blockchain-based project that aims to build a decentralized ecosystem for gamers. It features the GPN coin, which is a UTXO-based blockchain that uses the KaWPoW hashing algorithm, which is ASIC/FPGA resistant and can only be mined using GPUs. The initial block reward is 2000 coins and it will decrease by 1% every month due to a custom halving algorithm. Each block generates coins, with 51% going to the miner, 41% going to the gamers' fund, and 8% for development purposes and marketing. Rewards for games are calculated by a separate program and are paid from the game fund every day.

With Gamepass, gamers can communicate with each other and buy and sell accounts or game-related items on a marketplace with collateral or escrow. Gamers can earn rewards by playing popular video games like Dota2 and others, and the rewards calculation is based on public game statistics from official public APIs provided by game developers.

Gamepass aims to solve the problem of decentralization and interaction between gamers by providing an easy and transparent way for them to buy or sell their gaming property to other players. The project also aims to provide transparency in its work and algorithms to ensure fairness and accountability to the community.

Gamepass also features assets that are inherited from Ravencoin. These assets allow developers to create unique tokens that represent anything they want, such as in-game items or currencies.

Development Process
-------------------
The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/GamepassNetwork/GamepassCore/tags) are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Gamepass Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------
Gamepass Core is dedicated to ensuring that all new updates are thoroughly tested before entering the mainnet. This is why we have a testnet running alongside our main chain. While the testnet is running, we will regularly run unit_testing that is built into Gamepass Core and ensure all reports come back as PASSED.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is not straightforward.

About Gamepass
--------------
Gamepass is the currency for investors, gamers, and gaming developers. It will be implemented in games such as Dota 2 and many other popular games. With blockchain assets, developers can implement Gamepass assets into any game. The upcoming Gamepass marketplace will allow interaction between gamers.
